            </header>
            <p> Our goal for this project is to utilize computer vision AI systems to enable in-home pet identification
                and diagnostics.
            <h2>Specific Aims</h2>
            - Build and clean image datasets and annotate for training/testing
            <br>- Run automated workflow for processing images on cluster to create dataframe for analytics
            <br>- Perform domestic canine breed identification, key point/feature detection, detect bounding boxes, and
                assess behavioral classifiers
            <br>- Visualize data by different factors
            <br> - Assess algorithm accuracy for breed identification and behavioral prediction
            <p>
            <h2><b>Three Categories of the Project</b></h2>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Object Detection and Breed Identification</h3>
            <p>We used the computer technology related to computer vision technique. For all the pictures for training
                the
                objects have bounding box around them, we used yolov5 to train models. We then optimized performance by
                adjusting number of epochs, batch size, and image augmentation parameters, and also compared performance
                for Yolov5 and v8.
            </p>
            <p>Below are some examples of object detection and the graph of relation of accuracy and epochs</p>

            </p>
            <h3>Synthetic Data Generation </h3>
            <p>In order to improve dataset size and variation, we implemented a synthetic data generation pipeline using
                Autodesk
                Maya and allowed us generate any amount photorealistic synthetic images with high randomization and
                expandability. </p>
            <h3>Pose Estimation</h3>
            <p>We used DeepLabCut to get keypoints detected for different animals. It can detect the joints in a picture or video.</p>
