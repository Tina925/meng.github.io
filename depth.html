							<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong> DEPTH FIRST SEARCH PROJECT</strong></h2>
						</header>
						<p> This is a project I worked on in my sephomore year. 
							This project includes conplex structures, 2D array coordinates, and depth first search. 
							This is the first time I get in touch with recursion in C language. This project uses two enumerations. The first defines the types of maze squares:
							
							<p>typedef enum SquareType {</p>
								<p>WALL = '#',</p>
								<p>SPACE = '.',</p>
								<p>START = 's',</p>
								<p>END = 'e'</p>
							<p>} SquareType;</p>

						<p>The second enumeration defines the possible directions:</p>

							<p>typedef enum PathType {</p>
								<p>NORTH = 'n',</p>
								<p>SOUTH = 's',</p>
								<p>EAST = 'e',</p>
								<p>WEST = 'w'</p>
							<p>} PathType;</p>
						<p>With those two enumerations in mind, I then construct the complex structure to clarify the ways visited, and x y postions etc.</p>
						<p>Below are the most important conceptual code in this recustion process. In the depthFirstSolve Function, I first listed out two condition that if is at end or 
							not in condition Squre type. Then I listed out four directions then how will the position change corresponds with each direction. Then I put it in the for loop 
							which is the recursion process overall.
