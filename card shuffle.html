						</header>
						<p> This project is based on C language, and the purpose is to shuffle a deck of cards. Riffle shuffling technics applied to this project. 
							The concept I used in this project is to divide the cards into two groups, and there are different possible orders can the new deck have. There is a formula by writing this out, for a deck of k distict cards, 
							there are k! possible orders. 
							<p>Below are my code for the dividing the deck section.</p>
							<p style="text-align: center;">
								<a href="#" ><img src="images/project/card.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
									<p>I set up a big for loop to go through each card in left deck, and then to the same thing for the right deck. Then I set up another for loop for print each card in left and right deck.
										I find out it is interesting while using for loops in this project by getting all kinds of outputs, it just like a shuffling machine by running loops in code.
