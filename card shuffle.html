							<h2><strong> CARD SHUFFLING PROJECT</strong></h2>
						</header>
						<p> This is a project I worked on in my freshman year. 
							In order to improve safety and increase mobility around campus, we designed a speed trap sensor to put in intersection on campus in order to allow pedestrians to be warned if bikes or any other oncoming traffic is comming. 
							My group did a thorough background research and used protottping, testing, and weighted decision matric (WDM) to construct the final design. 
							<br />Below is the link to my final report document.
